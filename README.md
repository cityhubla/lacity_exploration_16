# lacity_exploration_16

## Lost in Tweets

This is an exploration into the twitter conversations on issues affecting Los Angeles City, County, and California. From first post to multiple branches and breakdowns in communication. From initial thoughts to mansplaining. From consideration of local contexts to dropping policy from afar. It's more coherent listening face to face, even better if there is a long dry erase board for writing.

The following is a selection of these conversations.
